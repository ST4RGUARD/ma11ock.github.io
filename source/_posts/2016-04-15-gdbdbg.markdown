# GDB Debug Symbols
  - Gives various information about variables, functions, etc in a binary that can be read by the debugger
  - Can be part of the binary or a separate file
  - GCC -ggdb to compile with debug symbols for gdb

  - list will drop us to the main function if it has the source available
  - list # will take you to that line of the source
  - if compiled with dbg symbols info variables will display found variables under defined for the source file
  - if not compiled with symbols or source not available, the variables may be found and listed under non-debugging symbols

  - here we use info functions to display all functions found in the source with debug options given at compile time
