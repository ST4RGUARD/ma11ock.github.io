## strace
*Notes and material referenced from SecurityTube GDB Primer*

- *strace man page may need to* **apt-get install strace** *on kali linux*

This section will cover the strace utility. Strace runs against the command or executable given. It intercepts the system calls
for these processes and records them. This provides very useful diagnostic, and debugging to the user as well as the ability to profile programs.

<!--more-->
  - **usage:** strace executable args
  - system calls are displayed as they relate to our program line by line
  - **-r** is a relative timestamp that gives insight into how long each sys call takes

  - if we are interested in specific system calls or multiple calls in the executable
  - **strace -e connect,write binary args**

  - we can also monitor sys calls of a running process
  - **nc google.com 80**

![strace netcat example](/images/stracenc.png)

  - we netcat google on port 80
  - we then grab the process ID of the running process & then run strace on that PID
  - **ps ax|grep nc**
  - **strace -p PID**

  - strace now says process 6697 attached, and is waiting
  - if we enter **GET /** as seen in our netcat example picture - all of the sys calls used to perform that request are displayed in the above pic

  - we can print a statistical summary of all the sys calls made
  - **strace -c binary args**
